Steps to execute:

./run.sh

The output will take a while to generate as over 100000 iterations are considered

The output will be generated on the terminal

The values are in cpu clock cycles so in order to get time in nanoseconds multiply the value by 0.4 (as we have 2.5GHz processor)

Cpu cycles was used as it provides most accurate measurement
